## What is vpn-guardian?

`vpn-guardian.sh` is a lightweight shell script designed for routers or Linux-based devices running a single VPN tunnel (WireGuard or OpenVPN). It monitors the VPN connection status and sends a Telegram notification **only when the VPN status changes** (connected ‚Üí disconnected or vice versa).

This means you won‚Äôt get spammed with constant status messages ‚Äî only important status changes trigger alerts. For example, if the VPN disconnects due to power loss or network issues and then reconnects, you will receive a notification for both events.

---

## Features

- Supports monitoring of WireGuard and OpenVPN tunnels.
- Sends notifications via Telegram bot API.
- Avoids multiple simultaneous script runs using a lockfile.
- Sends alerts **only when the VPN connection status changes**.
- Simple to setup on routers or Linux systems.

## Requirements

- `curl` command available.
- Access to Telegram bot token and chat ID. (Check at the end, how to create it).
- Router or Linux device with VPN (WireGuard or OpenVPN).
- Basic knowledge of SSH and cron jobs.

---

## Installation & Usage

1. SSH into your router or Linux device (e.g., 192.168.8.1, 192.168.1.1 ‚Äî replace with your actual IP):
    ```bash
    ssh root@192.168.8.1
    ```

2. Remove old versions or fix issues
    If you‚Äôve already created the script before and want to remove it (e.g. to fix a mistake or start clean), use
    ```bash
    rm /root/vpn-guardian.sh
    ```
    This ensures you delete any previous version before creating or correcting the script.
3. Create the script file:
    ```bash
    vi /root/vpn-guardian.sh
    ```
    Paste the contents of `vpn-guardian.sh` script, then save and exit (press `i` to insert, paste, then `Esc` ‚Üí `:wq` ‚Üí `Enter`).

4. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x /root/vpn-guardian.sh
    ```

5. Test run the script:
    ```bash
    /root/vpn-guardian.sh
    ```

6. Check script debug output (optional):
    ```bash
    sh -x /root/vpn-guardian.sh
    ```

7. Setup cron job to run the script every 5 minutes:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    Add these lines:
    ```
    @reboot /root/vpn-guardian.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
    */5 * * * * /root/vpn-guardian.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
    ```

8. Verify cron is running:
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep cron
    ```

---

## How it works

- The script checks if the VPN is connected via WireGuard or OpenVPN.
- It reads the previous VPN status from a temporary file.
- If the status has changed, it sends a Telegram message to notify you.
- A lockfile prevents multiple simultaneous executions.
- Only status changes trigger notifications, avoiding message spam.

## Notes

- Replace IP addresses or usernames to match your actual device.
- Make sure `cron` is installed and running if using a minimal Linux distribution or OpenWrt.

## üîß How to Create a Telegram Bot & Get Your Chat ID

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**

   * Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**.
   * Start a conversation and type `/newbot`.
   * Follow the instructions to choose a name and username.
   * Once done, you will receive your **bot token**, which looks like:

     ```
     123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
     ```

2. **Get Your Chat ID**

   * Send any message to your new bot from your Telegram account.
   * Then, open this URL in your browser (replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual token):

     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
     ```
   * You will see a JSON response. Look for something like:

     ```json
     {
       "update_id":123456789,
       "message":{
         "chat":{
           "id":123456789,
           ...
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   * The `id` value inside `chat` is your **Chat ID**.

3. **Important Notes**

   * You must send a message to the bot before using `getUpdates` ‚Äî otherwise, the chat ID will not appear.
   * Make sure your bot is **not private** or blocked.
